# Dort-blockchain


Dort is a modern cryptocurrency built from scratch, designed to be efficient, decentralized, and secure. Here are some of the features and benefits:
based consensus which allows anyone to farm with commodity hardware
* Very easy to use full node and farmer GUI and cli (thousands of nodes active on mainnet)
* Simplified UTXO based transaction model, with small on-chain state
* BLS keys and aggregate signatures (only one signature per block)
* [Pooling protocol](in development) that allows farmers to have control of making blocks
* Support for light clients with fast, objective syncing
* A growing community of farmers and developers around the world

on your router or add a NAT (for IPv4 but not IPv6) and firewall rules to allow
TCP port 8444 access to your peer.
These methods tend to be router make/model specific.

Most users should only install harvesters, farmers, plotter, full nodes, and wallets.
Building Timelords and VDFs is for sophisticated users, in most environments.
Dort Network and additional volunteers are running sufficient Timelords
for consensus.
